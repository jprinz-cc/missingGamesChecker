    <Name>Battle Chess</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1993-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear>1994</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>Battle Pinball is a Japanese-only release where players play competitive pinball against the computer or another player. Players pick between one of four characters, each with their own dedicated pinball table. The game then moves to a split-screen view, where both players play their respective table and try to get a higher score than their opponent.

Other options include a 1-player "story" mode where the player selects a character and battles the other three. Winning here gives a character-specific CG victory movie. Players can also play against multiple opponents in a tournament mode (complete with brackets), though a maximum of two players will be playing at once. As with Real Pinball, the view angle is fixed and cannot be changed.</Overview>

    <Overview>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.

Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals.

Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</Overview>

    <Name>BFS: Blue Forest Story</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1996-04-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Blue Forest Story is set in a medieval fantasy land, which is controlled by the powerful Empire. There are in fact two stories in the game, featuring two different characters, who live in different provinces of the Empire. The boy Wallace enjoys a peaceful life with his family in a quiet village; the girl Rakjit witnesses persecution and death of her mother, and joins a resistance movement that specializes in magics. The paths of the two young people will eventually lead to the same goal - liberation of the world; but when and how it will be achieved, remains unclear...

The game plays for the most part like a traditional Japanese-style top-down RPG. Both Wallace and Rakjit eventually gather a party, which roams the world, visiting various locations and advancing the story in a predominantly linear fashion. Appearance of random enemies triggers a battle screen, which is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battle system is rather old-fashioned, with physical and magical attacks; level progression is automatic, as in most games of the genre.

Sometimes the game prompts the player to choose an action or a response; while the flow of the story is rarely influenced by the player's decision, the game keeps track of these decisions, evaluating the player's attitude between chapters.</Overview>

C.P.U Bach can more easily understood as a software program that allows the user to assist the program in creating music. The user does not create music directly. Instead, the user selects from a set of variables, including type of music and instruments. The software produces a musical concert from the variables selected. The music created is unique to the variables selected, and is not pre-recorded. The game was intended to show the power of computers to create music with a limited amount of user input. Imitating the style of the famous composer Johann Sebastian Bach was thought to make it especially impressive.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>1996-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Based on the Casper film, the game pits you in the role of the friendly ghost trying to make a friend and a second chance at life instead of scaring everyone away.

The plot centers around the "spoiled, grasping inheritor of Whipstaff Manor" - Carrigan Crittenden. She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls. Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures.

Casper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare "Fleshies" and thwart Casper's efforts. The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.</Overview>

    <Name>D</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-04-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>D is basically an adventure game in which the player-controlled main character Laura Harris, must find out why her father has gone on a murderous rampage and is holding hostages in a hospital. The game uses pre-generated computer graphics and full-motion video to tell its story. The player has two hours to solve the mystery of why Laura's father went on his bloody massacre. The player manipulates the Laura character from both first-person and third-person perspectives.

The game has several endings, a time's up game ending, a good and bad ending, and a 100% completion ending. The ending a player witnessed was based on their actions throughout the game. The 100% complete ending includes the good ending and the addition of the sounds of a newborn baby crying. Some players inexplicably concluded that this sound of a baby crying meant that the visibly not-pregnant Laura gave birth at the end of the game, a storyline development that some misguidedly believed would lead directly into the sequel, D2.</Overview>

    <Overview>In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.

The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the downtime.

A third consideration is the "Virtual Operating System" controlling all major base functions. You use this interface to repair damage from attacks, monitor intruders, and place robot sentries to guard key passages. As you find more access keys, you can increase the software's efficiency to the point that you can command turrets remotely, or set them to auto-attack with a high degree of success.

As defending the base becomes more automated and efficient, you have more time to search the levels for keys. Your ultimate goal is to find the clearance to self-destruct the base, defend your escape shuttle, and get out alive.</Overview>

It's interactive, it's entertaining, it doesn't have commercials. What it does have is more than 200 topics in 4 categories - world news, politics, sports and show biz - that you select from. Pick a month, pick a topic. Now sit back and watch Dennis lampoon and lambast everything from the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City to the bombing of Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Last Action Hero."

Players start off with a $5,000 loan in the retail version, or a $20,000 loan in the school version.  The money is used to pay for the land, dinosaurs, fencing, food and employees necessary to run the park and pay back the loan; failure to meet loan payments results in the park's foreclosure.

    <Name>Dragon's Lair</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>1994</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>Dragon's Lair features the hero, Dirk the Daring, attempting to rescue Princess Daphne from the evil dragon Singe, who has locked Princess Daphne in the foul wizard Mordroc's castle. The screen shows animated cutscenes, and the player executes an action by selecting a direction or pressing the sword button with correct timing, requiring the player to memorize each scenario in order to clear each quick time event. The comedy aspects of the game stemmed not only from the bizarre looking creatures and humorous death scenes, but also the fact that while Dirk was a skilled knight, he was somewhat clumsy in his efforts, as well as being a reluctant hero, prone to shrieking and reacting in horror to the various dangers he encounters.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>1995-05-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the future, mankind has been enslaved in a virtual reality simulation known as Perfect. This simulation is controlled by an entity known as Perfect1 and it has to be destroyed in order to shut down the system. You are Immercenary Number Five, and it's your job to do it. 

From a secret lab you log into the simulation which sends you to a place in Perfect known as the Garden. Every entity in the game has a certain rank that determines its offensive and defensive capabilities. You start at 255, the lowest rank, and must rise in ranks to defeat Perfect1, who holds rank number 1. To do so, you destroy higher-ranked Rithms, as the other entities in the game are called. To pass beyond certain ranks, unique Rithms high in the Perfect hierarchy have to be destroyed.

Different weapons and power-ups can be collected and spent offensive and defensive energy can be recharged at energy spires. In the center of the Garden is a place called DOAsys, which functions as a neutral zone and healing center. There you can talk to other Rithms and ask for hints about combating special Rithms and where to find special items. These dialogue sequences take the form of live action clips of actors in elaborate costumes playing the Rithms.

When the player logs out of the simulation or is violently forced out, he returns to the lab where one may load and save a game and access detailed statistics on the trips to Perfect.</Overview>

    <Name>J.B. Harold: Blue Chicago Blues</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>1995</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>This is a detective story about the fearless private investigator J.B. Harold. This time, an unknown woman in a red dress was murdered in Chicago. A female detective who began investigating the murder was killed as well, and this time the killer made it look like a suicide. J.B. Harold arrives at Chicago and has now to work together with the local police and to solve the mystery.

J.B. Harold: Blue Chicago Blues is an interactive movie. Most of the player's time is spent watching movie footage (with real actors and scenery). At certain points, the movie freezes, and the player is presented with a screen with two or more choices. Each choice advances the clock, so it is necessary to plan well in order not to run out of time and to successfully solve the case.</Overview>

    <Name>Jammit</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-11-25T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Whiners, better give this game a miss, 'cause Jammit's the closest thing you'll ever find to real street hoops. Don't even think of looking for an official--in this game, it's jam-or-be-jammed--and great D leaves the opposition gasping. In Intensive Care.

Step onto one of the five stylin' courts, and the air show begins. Revers jams. Fade-away jumpers. And way more attitude--and altitude--than you'll ever find in the so-called pros.

Get past our three asphalt warriors, and we'll send you to meet the Judge, and you'd better bring your license to drive. Put some money down, talk a little trash, then walk the walk. Or else you'll watch yourself getting faced on our exclusive Slam Cam...

These guys don't even know how to spell "foul."

Mastered one on one? There are six more game variations out there, chump.

When you go to the hoop, the Slam Cam zooms in on the action.
Reasons to lay down the cash:

-"The Slam Cam"--get up-close-and-impersonal as players drive the lane
-Over 700 frames of digitized animation
-Five graffiti covered basketball courts
-Side bets, 'cause only money really talks
-Enough digitized trash talk to dis the entire neighborhood
-Seven different streetball games: Sweat, 1-on-1, 2 Hot, Poison, Slams Only, in-2-it and Frenzy</Overview>

    <Overview>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately, these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers, and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom is a selection of functions that can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating, and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</Overview>

    <Overview>Lucienne’s Quest is a game in classic roleplaying genre, but presented in full 3D graphics (and sprite characters) uncommon for the time. The battles are fought in traditional turn-based manner, but allow for more strategy than most classic RPGs. The game places ambient obstacles on the battlefield to block some attack paths, but allows the player to strategically reposition his fighters along the bottom two rows of the map before every turn to take advantage of the terrain. The game also features a dynamic day/night system which serves little purpose other than changing one of your party members from human into a werewolf and back.</Overview>

    <Overview>The sequel to American Laser Game's original Mad Dog McCree, with pretty much the same gameplay and motion capture graphics. This PC conversion seems to have been tweaked a bit to be more stable than the original Mad Dog. There's also somewhat limited replay value as you can choose from 3 different guides for 3 different routes through the game.</Overview>

    <Overview>Mag Dog McCree and his gang have kidnapped the Mayor and his daughter, and its up to you to rescue them. You must blast through bars and bank robberies to take the gang out and save everything you regard as good and true. Where the game differed from other Operation Wolf-influenced shoot 'em ups was in the use of live video, with real people appearing on the screen before you shoot them down. You have unlimited continues with which to reach the end, so the actors will have their screen deaths seen by as many people as they would had they starred in a film.</Overview>

The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.

The game is broken down into three types of puzzle games. First the player chooses from one of nine female pornstars. Each porn actress has a picture and a video clip related to her. This picture can either be made into a jigsaw puzzle, a slider puzzle, or a memory match game where when each card is matched and disappears more of the background picture is revealed. Completing any of these three puzzles unlocks a softcore pornographic clip from a Vivid Video movie.</Overview>

Which means, if there is the slightest chance that something goes wrong, then it certainly will go wrong. Even more unusual are the graphics in the game which are drawn in the style of MS Paint pictures.</Overview>

    <Name>Myst</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books. 

The game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.</Overview>

    <Name>N.O.B.: Neo Organic Bioform</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-12-15T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Captured by a corrupt organization, the player has been subjected to tests which mutated them into a ghastly new form. To reclaim their human form, the player must explore the research facility and fight other mutants - "Neo Organic Bioforms". 

The player selects one of seven possible forms and spends points to customize its abilities and attack powers along the way. Exploration is performed in first person, moving through the hallways in a fixed, grid-based system. Players can watch their minimap to track or avoid other bioforms. If the player encounters another mutant, the game switches to a tactical, turn-based fighting system. The player and the computer both try to target weak points on their enemy, with the winner of each turn shown attacking the other in an animated cutscene. The graphics are most noteworthy in using stop-motion puppets for all the bioforms, giving them a somewhat realistic look.

N.O.B. was only released in Japan, and was one of the few games published by Sanyo.</Overview>

    <Name>Nishimura Kyotarou Travel Mystery: Akugyaku no Kisetsu</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Late at night in the mid of July, a jogging man was found dead, crossbow bolt piercing his heart and a couple of photos of a swimsuit model in his death grip. You play a chief inspector Totsukawa, a fictional detective created by Kyoutarou Nishimura (西村 京太郎), a Japanese writer of a mystery novels. The victim appears to be living in a nearby apartment, and after checking the crime scenes and gathering clues, talking to witnesses and person who found the body would be the next logical step.

Unlike the PSP version release 15 years later, this game uses live-action during both cut-scenes and in-game investigation while gameplay relies of icons which let you listen to what others have to say, talk to witnesses and suspects, and investigate the crime scenes. At the beginning of each day you start with a meeting to discuss what you've uncovered thus far with your subordinates and decide what to do and where to go next. Each day progresses as you move from location to location, leaving you with limited number of locations you can visit before the day ends, so following clues and figuring out where is the best thing to go next is of utmost importance in order to solve the crime.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear>1994</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>You play a Trashman, a bounty hunter paid to capture criminal scum hiding on harsh alien worlds.

Your job is to race the enemy crime boss to the finish, blasting his goons along the way. Get blown up or drive too slowly and the boss gets away. But if you make it to the check point in time, you block the boss' escape and trap him on the planet.

You can upgrade your vehicle with the cash from your bounties. You can also go up against a buddy in the vertical split-screen deathmatch mode.

Off-World Interceptor's most unique feature is the storyline, told in full-motion video. Standard for the time. But OWIE's FMV is mocked by a couple of guys sitting in chairs, a la Mystery Science Theater 3000.</Overview>

    <Overview>If you've ever thought of what it feels like to be the ball in a pinball machine, playing PaTaank might give you some idea. Instead of flapping the flippers, the player controls the ball, or in PaTaank, a UFO-shaped puck around the three different tables. The tables are named Surf Room, Luv Room, and Disaster Room and they are connected to each other via Nexus. Player can choose to play one room or in the MetaGame mode, all of them in sequence. Each room has an objective and in the MetaGame mode, player must reach that objective to advance into the next room via the Nexus.

Like any pinball, there are targets, tunnels, blocks, and all sorts of flashing things that increase the score, light up letters, or grant bonus items. In addition to inertial control of the puck, player can apply thrust, which is limited, and activate magnetos, which are scattered around the room.</Overview>

    <Name>Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors</Name>
    <Overview>Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors is an unreleased video game that was planned for release initially on the Sega CD in April 1995 and to be followed by PC and 3DO versions later that year. The game stars the comedy-magician duo Penn &amp; Teller. The game is composed of several minigames and an adventure/platform game starring Penn &amp; Teller. All the minigames, with one exception, were made for the sole purpose of enabling the owner of the game to fool their friends by many different means, designating the games "scam minigames" and virtual tricks. Penn &amp; Teller's Smoke and Mirrors is unofficially the video game equivalent of Penn &amp; Teller's Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends video, which has the same purpose, and uses properties of the video medium itself for the tricks. One of the games most infamous mini-games is Desert Bus, this is considered by Penn to be the "best part" of the collection, Desert Bus is a trick minigame and a featured part of Electronic Gaming Monthly's preview. The objective of the game is to drive a bus from Tucson, Arizona, to Las Vegas, Nevada, in real time at a maximum speed of 45 MPH. This is often cited by critics as being one of the worst games of all time.</Overview>

Three years later the founders of the colony felt it needed to be protected, and chose five best policemen from Earth to do that: Gates Becker from Scotland Yard, the Japanese Sadaoki Tokugawa, Salvatore Toscanini from New York, and two policemen from Los Angeles: Jonathan Ingram and his best friend Ed Brown. During a routine patrol on Beyond Coast, something happened to Jonathan's space suit. He was sucked into space and presumed dead. Twenty-five years later, he is miraculously discovered in his life pod, alive. He still looks like a young man, but in reality he is fifty-five years old.

Trying to forget his past, Jonathan opens an investigation agency on Earth. One day, his ex-wife unexpectedly pays him a visit. She has re-married during Jonathan's prolonged absence, and asks him to find her missing husband. When she leaves the office, her car explodes, and she dies. Determined to fulfill her final request, Jonathan prepares to re-visit Beyond Coast.

Policenauts is a Japanese-style adventure with action elements, similar in many ways to Snatcher. The player interacts with the environment in a point-and-click fashion: positioning a cursor over an object allows the player character to examine it or perform other context-dependent actions. There are a few puzzles in the game, but most of the time the story is advanced by visiting various locations, examining objects, and talking to characters. Conversations usually include a selection of topics. 

Action sequences are similar to those of Snatcher, but are more numerous and varied. The player must rapidly shoot enemies moving within a one-screen area viewed from a first-person perspective, reloading the gun manually and trying to eliminate the enemy before Jonathan's health bar is depleted.</Overview>

    <Overview>A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods. This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress. In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing. It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game. Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat. The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people.</Overview>

    <Overview>This game is an innovative slant on the interactive movie.

That way you can find out things about the case you couldn't otherwise. The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most people might not want to play through again.</Overview>

    <Name>Putt-Putt's Fun Pack</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1993-03-26T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Putt-Putt's Fun Pack is a spin-off of the Putt-Putt series released in March 26, 1993 by Humongous Entertainment for the 3DO, MS-DOS and Macintosh systems. This is the first spin-off game Humongous Entertainment produced. It features six mini-games, most of which are played with Putt-Putt. Two of these games were previously featured in Putt-Putt Joins the Parade.

All of the background music is entirely recycled from Putt-Putt Joins the Parade. This game was later reissued and combined with Fatty Bear's Fun Pack in 1994 to become Putt-Putt &amp; Fatty Bear's Activity Pack.

Games
Tic-Tac-Toe
The player plays Tic-tac-toe against Putt-Putt. The player always draws a green X on a square, while Putt-Putt always draws a purple O. It becomes a tie if neither the player nor Putt-Putt gets three in a straight line. Once a game is done it is reset, and then whoever went second before will now go first.

Pinball
The player can create their own game of pachinko. To make the pinball go up, click on the spring. Clicking on the empty spaces will place a ramp on them and clicking on the ramps themselves will either rotate them or remove them. The pinball will bounce around the ramp until it either drops down to the bottom and through the hole or bounces around indefinitely until the player quits. This game was originally shown in the toy store of Putt-Putt Joins the Parade, but its background is pink here, while it was beige there. This game has no difficulty selection or dialogue.

Checkers
The player plays checkers against Putt-Putt. The blue checkers are always the player's, while the red ones are always Putt-Putt's. Putt-Putt moves pieces remotely using his antenna. Once a checker reaches the opponent's side, a star-shaped wand flies over and gives it a crown. The loser is whoever has no pieces remaining or whoever has no remaining moves and fewer pieces than the opponent. Once a game is done it is reset, and then whoever went second before will now go first.

Cheese King
This is a spelling game akin to hangman. A picture is shown and the player must spell out what the picture is by choosing letters. Whenever a player chooses a wrong letter, a crowned mouse takes a piece of cheese. Once it's all taken, or if the player clicks on the picture, the correct word is spelled out by Putt-Putt. At the easiest level, the player only has to select the first letter. Once a game is finished, the quantity of cheese is always reset to all six pieces.

Remember
The player plays a game of concentration. The cards display pictures of various everyday objects, although some cards depict Putt-Putt, Fatty Bear, or the Junior Adventures logo. After all matches are made, Putt-Putt shuffles the cards to play again.

Puzzle Blocks
This game features nine squares with pictures on them. To solve a puzzle, the squares need to be clicked until they all form the correct picture (the squares need to all be part of the same circus act). This game was originally shown in the toy store of Putt-Putt Joins the Parade, but this version has different pictures than the full-length game. This game has no difficulty selection or dialogue.</Overview>

    <Name>Pyramid Intruder</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the year 2035, humanity discovers a giant pyramid on the planet Mars. It turns out to have been created by the ancient people of Mu, whose advanced civilization had been forgotten by Earth, and who counterattack following humanity's intrusion. The player takes control of a ship leading the resistance by flying directly into the pyramid.

Pyramid Intruder is a very traditional FMV-based rail shooter. The player's ship and small enemies are sprites, while the stages are presented using full-screen FMV stored as laserdisc video. The 3DO port improves on the original game by switching from a first-person perspective to a behind-the-ship view in order to make it possible to dodge enemies; it also adds new realtime 3D levels in between the original levels.</Overview>

    <Name>Return to Zork</Name>
    <Overview>You are standing behind the white house. There is something in the mailbox. A video message from a wizard informing you that you are the sweepstakes winner to the Valley of the Sparrows... right now, by magic flight. Upon arriving at this mysterious place however, not everything is as it should be. There's nobody to meet you and those who you do come across don't seem to have any knowledge about a sweepstakes. It looks like this is a private vacation and you'll need to find your own way through this land.

Return to Zork is a first-person adventure game using live actors and video sequences. The game is similar to Myst in interface; the player is also able to rotate the viewpoint to discover new areas and uncover items that can be used or picked up. Various characters will be met along the way and spoken to via a system of dialog choices. The game allows the player to experiment with items in various ways, including discharging them; however, this often leads to "dead ends", rendering it impossible to complete the game.</Overview>

    <Name>Rise of the Robots</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Electrocorp, the world's leading manufacturer and developer of advanced robotics ran the Leader Project to develop a multi-task, ultra-intelligent, self-aware robot to manage every aspect of the factory plant. The end result was the Supervisor Droid, a machine capable of assuming any form and accessing any database. But when an EGO virus infected the Supervisor's self-awareness it started to consider its need above of those of the company, infecting the other robots in the plant and declaring itself their leader. Electrocorp then sent its top-secret ECO32-5 Cyborg to infiltrate the plant and destroy the supervisor.

Rise of the Robots is a versus fighting game. The player controls the ECO32-5 Cyborg and must fight all the other robots in the plant until finally meeting the Supervisor Droid. The controls consist of 3 buttons for punches and 3 buttons for kicks (one for each in the Game Gear version), and jumping, moving, crouching and blocking are performed with the directional pad. The Cyborg has two super moves, the Turbo Head Butt and the Shoulder Barge. The player can choose the difficulty, number of rounds and time limit for the fights, as well as turn turn the super moves off.

The game has three modes: mission, where the player fights each robot in a fixed order; training, where the player can fight any robot in any desired order; and two players versus mode (absent in the Game Gear version), where the second player chooses any of the enemy robots to fight with. It features an AI system that reacts to the player style, 3D rendered cutscenes and the title song was composed by Queen's guitarist Brian May.</Overview>

    <Name>Road &amp; Track Presents: The Need for Speed</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-12-02T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Road &amp; Track Presents: The Need for Speed is a racing video game developed by EA Canada, originally known as Pioneer Productions, and published by Electronic Arts, released for the 3DO in 1994, and ported to MS-DOS in 1995. Another version of the game, The Need for Speed: Special Edition, was released in 1996 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn platforms. The original 3DO version offers eight sports cars, including several exotic models and Japanese imports, and tasks the player with racing in three realistic point-to-point tracks either with or without a computer opponent. Subsequent ports of the game normally include an additional ninth car and have more tracks, including closed circuits. Checkpoints, traffic vehicles, and police pursuits commonly appear in the races.

The game was noted for its realism and audio and video commentaries. Electronic Arts collaborated with automotive magazine Road &amp; Track to match vehicle behaviour, including the mimicking of the sounds made by the vehicles' gear control levers. The game also contained precise vehicle data with spoken commentary, several "magazine-style" images of each car's interior and exterior and short video clips highlighting the vehicles set to music.</Overview>

    <Name>Road Rash</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>This is a remake of the original Road Rash from the early nineties. For those who have not played the original, you are competing against thirteen other "Road Rashers" who will stop at nothing to win 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. During the race, you have two options available to you: you can either do your best to cross the finish line, or use your weapon to bring the Rashers to the ground if they are giving you trouble. If you do the latter, your opponents will do the same to you during the next race that takes place. 

There are five circuits to race: The City, The Peninsula, Pacific Highway, Sierra Nevada, and Napa Valley. Some of these circuits are dangerous. As well as the obstacles and traffic that you encounter along the way, there are also cops driving on bikes who will arrest you if you happen to crash or stop your bike near them, and you have to pay a fine in order to get in any more races. Your bike will be wrecked if you crash too many times, and you have to pay for damages, but the amount you have to pay depends on the bike that you are riding. Once you have completed the first five circuits, you have to race them again another four times - but at a much more difficult level. Manage to win all five circuits on all levels, and you win the Road Rash cup.

There are about five bikes to choose from, which are divided into three groups. Rat, Sport, and Super. You start the first level with a Rat bike, but as you proceed through the levels, it is important to pick bikes from a different bike class.

If you have no plans to win the Road Rash cup, you can choose the game's Thrash mode. The difference between this and the other mode is that there is no money involved (ie: you are not allowed to buy bikes), and you are competing against fourteen opponents. And if you wreck your bike or you get busted, you have to start all over again. Regardless of the mode you pick, you will always start in the last place.

The remake also contains FMV movies that usually depict the outcome of the races, as well as limited songs performed by various recording artists, including Soundgarden, Therapy?, Monster Magnet, and Swervedriver. These songs can be changed on-the-fly via the game's options menu.</Overview>

    <Name>Seal of the Pharaoh</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>1994</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>Seal of the Pharaoh is a light RPG with simple real-time combat and some puzzle-solving. The player takes control of the son of a prominent archaeologist, who has recently discovered the long lost tomb of Rassius III, and has gone missing. It is now up to the player to find him by exploring the tomb, but at the same time avoid the various traps and enemies laid out before them.

The perspective is from a first-person view as they progress through the maze-like pyramid equipped with a club, a shield and a diary. As they progress they must avoid traps, but also use their club and shield to take out enemies such as giant wasps, scorpions and even haunted urns. More powerful weapons and items can be obtained through further exploration as well as clues to decipher the diary and various puzzles that need to be solved in order to advance. The RPG element is present in weapon-training; the more the protagonist uses a weapon, the higher is the damage inflicted with it.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Another version of the ancient game of Mah-Jong. The player is presented with an arrangement of tiles, lined up together and stacked, with either 2 or 4 of each of an array of patterns. These must be removed by matching pairs, but only tiles which are visible and have a space to the left or right can be removed.

This release in the Activision's Shanghai series includes three games along with the Classic Shanghai. In The Great Wall, the tiles are stacked vertically, and fall when lower tiles are removed, a lá Tetris. In Beijing, gaps are created to slide groups of tiles along. The Golden Tile sees two players attempt to clear a set layout at once. The Triple-theme continues with three game modes: Solitaire, 2-player "Pandamonium", and Arcade. Three themed tile sets complete the "Triple Threat".</Overview>

    <Overview>Shootout at Old Tucson is a live-action laserdisc video game, released by American Laser Games in 1994 in the arcade. The game saw a limited production run and was the only release by the company never to be ported from the arcade. Soon after the game appeared on the market, American Laser Games went out of business, which, along with technical issues which limited its popularity in the arcades, further contributed to the title's obscurity. Shootout at Old Tucson was also one of the first games by American Laser Games developed based on 3DO  technology. The game was filmed at Old Tucson Studios.</Overview>

    <Overview>Aliens attempting to steal the World Cup have crashed as they tried to flee, and the Cup has been broken, its pieces scattered around the globe. As Soccer Kid, you must retrieve it. During your journey you will visit Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan, and finally the States.

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements. As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.</Overview>

    <Overview>Following the successful gameplay of Dragon's Lair, Don Bluth released this second conversion of his Laserdisc games series.

You're playing Dexter, a guy fighting the evil madman Borf who has kidnapped your girlfriend Kimberly and is now threatening the world with his dreaded weapon, the "Infanto Ray" which turns adults into small children.

The game plays like a comic strip - visuals are similar to many cartoon movies. In each scene you only have to decide which direction of the keyboard has to be hit in order to avoid one of the countless death screens and to advance to the next screen...</Overview>

    <Name>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>1995</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels is a mix of a First-Person-Shooter and a tactical fighting game. It is placed in the Warhammer 40k background of the Games Workshop table top games. It is the successor of the PC game Space Hulk from 1993 and it tells of the fight between the imperial Terminator Chapters and the Tyranid Gene Stealers.

You control up to ten Terminators. You give them orders in a tactical screen and/or take over one of them and then move in a 3D environment and fight the Gene Stealers just as in a First- Person-Shooter. So the game includes tactical planning and fighting in a good balance.</Overview>

    <Name>Star Control II</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Star Control II is a game based on exploration, space combat, diplomacy and resource gathering. Your main starship is the Precursor vessel and it can be used to travel between star systems; this uses up fuel. Raw materials are used as currency to make purchases in your space station headquarters; you can buy fuel, as well as improve your starship, buy smaller ships to accompany the starship as a fleet (to fight enemies), and hire crewmembers (who represent the "health" of your ships).

Raw materials are found on surfaces of planets and moons throughout the galaxy; you have to send a landing module to the planet and then guide it around the surface as it picks up the materials you found earlier with your scanner. Each planet is unique in the type of minerals and metals it is formed of. Some planets are plagued by natural dangers such as lightning storms, earthquakes or lava which can damage or destroy your landing modules. Non-sentient lifeforms can also be found and stunned to obtain biological samples. Special installations, objects and ruins can also be found on certain planets and explored.</Overview>

    <Overview>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.

A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, (unless he uses a flight stick with thrust controls such as 3DO's CH Pro stick) and must keep moving at all times.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates). You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies. It is your job to take control away from the competitors. The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control. Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates. As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</Overview>

    <Name>The Daedalus Encounter</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>1995</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>The interstellar war is over, leaving you, a casualty, as a disembodied brain inside a life support system. Your buddies rescue you from the lab so that you can go exploring - scavenging the galaxy for wreckage and artifacts left over from the war. In due course you stumble literally into an alien craft. With your own craft disabled, and the alien ship on a collision course, you must explore it to find out what has gone wrong and to make a course correction. 

Gameplay consists of conversations with your colleagues (displayed as live action video), animated exploration sequences, as well as puzzle-solving that mostly involves figuring out how to operate alien mechanisms. There is also a maze sequence and sporadic action-based tasks. There is no inventory to speak of, because, being a brain in a box. you have no pockets.

All the action takes place in an in-game window that is your view of the world. It takes up only a small part of the screen and the rest of the screen is taken up with a kind of fleshy 'inside of your head' background that is there to remind you that you are inside a machine. Three difficulty settings, in-game instruction and assistance, as well as a few extras (such as high-resolution pictures) are included.</Overview>

    <Overview>You are Chauncey, a serving lad who saves his monarch from choking on his meal. The King rewards you with his magical sword, Grimthwacker, and a village, and the mission to go forth and prosper by felling waves of Hordlings, who are bent on eating everything in the province. The better you get at defending villagers, crops, and cows from Hordlings, the better equipped you become. Success wins you further favor from the King, along with bigger challenges and more enmity from the evil High Chancellor. There are several types of Hordlings, each with their peculiar style of picking through the edibles under your care. Success is measured by how many villagers and crops survive each season's gluttonous attacks.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Incredible Machine is a puzzle game where the player has to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption to solve a simple puzzle. 

The game consists of a series of puzzles, each having a simple objective, such as "put the baseball into the basket" or "turn on the fan". To achieve this, the player is given a number of parts such as: balls, girders, rope, balloons, seesaws, cats or monkeys, and his job is to arrange and connect them on the playfield, so that, upon clicking the "start puzzle" button, the whole contraption activates and achieves the objective. 

For added difficulty, some puzzles have different gravity or air pressure from that of Earth. 

There is also a freeform mode where the player is given an unlimited number of parts to construct a machine of his own invention. The machines created this way can be saved to disk.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>1994-05-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Theatre Wars is an eccentric theatre management simulator. Divided into several stages, players are entrusted with running a theatre and putting on strange spectaculars to satisfy different requirements. Players have a budget to work within, which has to be spent on set design, dancers, and music selection. If their show performs well, players can make their budget back and then some - but if their show reviews poorly, they'll go bankrupt and might even see their theatre demolished to build a parking lot.</Overview>

    <Name>Theme Park</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</Overview>

    <Name>Toki o Koeta Tegami</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The year is 1945. Jerry Randolph, a female reporter working for the Chicago newspaper "Daily Casablanca", finds a diary belonging to her high school friend May Elgar, who has disappeared several years ago under mysterious circumstances. Jerry discovers that May's father was working on a groundbreaking scientific project. Too late to save Dr. Elgar from untimely death, Jerry uses a time machine constructed by him to travel to 1916, following the traces left by the criminals. In spite of its title, the game has little to do with the famous movie Casablanca beyond a few loose references. It is a text adventure with graphics, in which the player types text commands to interact with the environment. Several useful commands (including Look, Search, Take and Knock) can be accessed directly through function keys. Limited navigation between screens can be performed with directional arrows. English text input is supported to a certain degree, though text descriptions are in Japanese only.</Overview>

    <Name>Who Shot Johnny Rock?</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Another live-actor arcade shooter by American Laser Games (makers of Mad Dog McCree and Crime Patrol), Who Shot Johnny Rock is set in the classic 1920's style gangster era.

As the title suggests, you're supposed to find out who shot singer Johnny Rock (or at least who hired the guys who shot him) and put them behind bars.

There are some differences between this game and previous American Laser Games shooters. Instead of a wimpy pistol, you get a tommy gun (which doesn't need to be reloaded). Unfortunately, you also have limited ammo and need to buy more at times. Instead of lives you have a fixed supply of money, and each time you die you lose some cash. Lose it all and it's game over.</Overview>

    <Name>Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyoto Kurama Sansou Satsujin Jiken</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1994-03-20T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Kyouto Anba Sansou Satsujin Jiken (京都鞍馬山荘殺人事件) is a murder mystery adventure game based on writings of Misa Yamamura, a Japanese writer of murder mystery novels. The protagonist of the story is Akiko Sonoyama (園山千晶), freelancer who finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery after the son of the host dies during the dinner right after drinking the wine. The game uses live-action videos and actors and shows the player protagonist in 3rd-person during investigation, similar to other games of such era, such as The Beast Within or Phantasmagoria 2. During gameplay, the full-screen videos appear in the center of the screen with surrounding window showing various action icons and game progress. While the player character appears during cut-scenes and dialogues, navigating environment is done using 1st-person perspective. During dialogues player has a list of questions one can ask with replies being a set of live-action videos of certain character addressing the player.

15 years after the 3DO game release, the PSP remake with the same title was released. The main difference there is that live actors have all been removed and characters were replaced with silhouettes and game interface changed to look like a mystery visual novel but with a selectable actions such as talk or inquire which make the game less of a typical visual novel and only resemble it in graphical presentation by using static backgrounds with dialogue text over it.</Overview>

    <Name>DOOM: Jaguar Levels</Name>
    <Overview>takes the original 32X Doom and adds in all the previously missing levels from the Atari Jaguar version of Doom as well as the BFG 9000 weapon. To check out the new levels ported from the Jaguar version of Doom j﻿ust select Level 16 from the title menu and enjoy!

 It fixes the two biggest issues with the game, adding in the 7 missing levels from the Atari Jaguar version and the previously absent BFG 9000 weapon, but it still has all the other more minor issues that the 32X port of Doom is known for. It still runs in a bordered screen and still has some graphical glitches like the sprites for the rockets coming out of the rocket launcher backwards and Doomguy's hair randomly flipping around in the portrait at the bottom of the screen, but those were always pretty minor to me.

For reference, the new levels included in JagDoom 32X are:
Level 16: Tower of Babel
Level 17: Hell Keep
Level 18: Pandemonium
Level 19: House of Pain
Level 20: Unholy Cathedral
Level 21: Mt. Erebus
Level 22: Limbo</Overview>

    <Overview>It has been five years after the formation of the Worldwide Federation. Although war has been averted, terrorist cells around the world threaten the stability of the federation. To combat this menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal armored tank known as the Metal Head. You are a Metal Head pilot, and you have to use all the weapons at your disposal to take out the terrorists.

Metal Head is a bit of a variation on the usual giant robot combat game. The game's mission areas bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter than a simulation. The graphics are all rendered in texture mapped polygons, which is unusual for a 32X game.</Overview>

He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sonic the Hedgehog 32X is a port of the Mega Drive version of Sonic the Hedgehog to the Sega 32X by drx.

The main objectives of this port are to present homebrew developers with samples of working 32X code and improve the understanding of 32X, enhance Sonic 1 with 32X's features, and allow Sonic 1 ROM hackers to make use of 32X's features.

The release of Sonic32 came in three forms: a pure port from the original MD version, an on-going ROM hack utilizing some of 32X's features, and the source code.</Overview>

    <Name>Soulstar X</Name>
    <Overview>Soulstar was a Mega-CD game created by Core Design, and after its release, two seperate conversions were planned. One was a port to the Jaguar CD, under the same name, whereas the other was an updated version for the 32X, under the name Soulstar X. In the end, neither of them were released.

The 32X update was previewed in Sega Power’s August 1995 issue, but some of the screenshots provided are a bit suspect; At least one of them is identical to a screenshot used on Wikipedia (at the time of writing) to demonstrate the unreleased Jaguar version… Did Sega Power simply get screenshots from the Jaguar CD version due to a lack of available 32X screens? It’s difficult to say, but the preview does confirm a few things about the 32X update, specifically the addition of multiplayer, and a faster game overall. The game looks slightly better than the Mega-CD original.</Overview>

    <Name>The Amazing Spider-Man: Web of Fire</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>1996</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>The game features side-scrolling action in which Spider-Man has to take on various enemy types which want to kill him. Besides the usual range of melee kicks and punches, he also sticks to walls and uses special attacks based on his web fluid. Creating spider web "vines" are used to swing from building to building; either required to cross gaps or simply to progress faster in the levels. Every use of his fluid decreases a web bar which, just like health, is refilled by picking up items floating in the game world. The first goal of the game is to rescue the superhero Daredevil, who then continues to help Spider-Man out: after activating the associated special attack, Daredevil covers the screen with his attacks.</Overview>

Map06 is E3M3 and Map03 E3M6 (change position just when you access secret level from map03 and finish it you will direct to map04 by 32x doom engine)

Map 24 is the first secret level (episode 3) and Map 16 the second secret level (episode 4 - need to access it from menu).

Map 17 to 22 are just short levels with instance exit just not to left empty maps.

 Generally almost all episode 4 was very painful port. Due to 32x limitation (not only map size, also has limitation at half walls-freeze 32x- and does not support fast functions like opening door fast and not support switch with key) needed to replace fast functions and modify maps to run. Some maps may have slowdowns.</Overview>

    <Name>Virtua Hamster</Name>
    <Overview>Virtua Hamster is a unreleased Sega 32X game. The game was to star a variety of selectable rodents attached to rocket packs who could travel through a series of connected tubes, fighting each other and avoiding various obstacles.

It was built solely with the 32X in mind, however after the console failed development moved to the Sega Saturn for a short while before being axed completely. It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the "Virtua" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the title Virtual Hamster instead.

In August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map). A resets the game, and B/C can be used to move the camera forwards and backwards through the tube. There are also two Sega screens.</Overview>

    <Overview>It's World War II and you are B.J. Blazkowicz, the Allies' most valuable agent. In the midst of the German Blitzkrieg, the Spear that pierced the side of Christ is taken from Versailles by the Nazis and secured in the impregnable Castle Wolfenstein. According to legend, no man can be defeated when he has the Spear. Hitler believes himself to be invincible with the power of the Spear as his brutal army sweeps across Europe.

Your mission is to infiltrate the heavily guarded Nazi stronghold and recapture the Spear from an already unbalanced Hitler. The loss of his most coveted weapon could push him over the edge. It could also get you ripped to pieces.

Spear of Destiny is a prequel to Wolfenstein 3-D. It is a first-person shooter that uses the same engine and has the same gameplay, however the game is not divided into 6 separate episodes - all the levels are one long episode. 

The enemies and weapons are pretty much the same as in Wolfenstein 3-D. Only new additions include: new bosses, a new type of enemy, and a new pickup (a large box of ammo)</Overview>

    <Name>WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-11-01T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.</Overview>

    <Name>X-Men</Name>
    <Overview>X-Men is an unreleased game developed for the Sega 32X. It was set to be an exclusive title for the system, but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A working title appears to have been X-Men: Mind Games.

A prototype was dumped by Ryo Suzuki of SegaSaturno.com in August 2009. Most emulators will not run the game, however it is compatible with the latest releases of Kega Fusion. This prototype is very incomplete, and though gives hints that X-Men characters Wolverine, Rogue and Iceman would be playable, you can only control Bishop. Magazine shots show that the game progressed far enough for Wolverine to be included as a playable character.

It has been suggested that the game eventually became the Sega Saturn/PlayStation/DOS game, The Incredible Hulk: The Pantheon Saga.</Overview>

    <Name>xRick</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-05-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Way before Lara Croft, back in the 1980’s and early 1990’s, Rick Dangerous was the Indiana Jones of computer games, running away from rolling rocks, avoiding traps, from South America to a futuristic missile base via Egypt and the Schwarzendumpf castle.

You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe. However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</Overview>

    <ReleaseYear>2011</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>What started as a 3D engine for the Game Boy Advance was ported to many platforms, including iPhone and Sega 32X. Intended to show the true 3D capabilities of the Sega 32x rather than Doom's raycasting 3D, this game feels a lot like a Doom clone hack in many ways.</Overview>

    <Name>Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>1995-06-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter is similar gameplay-wise to Sega's arcade game Zaxxon. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment. The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.

Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element. Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit. To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups. In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems. This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.</Overview>
