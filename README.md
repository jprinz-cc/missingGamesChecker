# missingGamesChecker

Simple tool that will compare your Launchbox platform XML files (your loaded Launchbox games) to the LaunchboxDB local XML file. The output shows game Title and DatabaseID based on LaunchboxDB.

Please note:
  - This only checks against the local copies of the files.
  - Designed against Launchbox 13.5 file formatting and XML naming conventions.
  - This is not a complete platform library check as Launchbox states their DB may not be complete and could be missing games.
